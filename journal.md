## Wireframes

Before starting work on the site, I drew up some wireframes using Moqup's online service:

##  Jekyll

Overall throughout the process I found Jekyll to be difficult to work with. Despite choosing one of the simpler themes to work with,
I felt frequently stymied by the difficulty of changing page elements and styling. The theme I was working with was not compatible with the stylesheet I wanted to use and as such, I had to use inline CSS to style my pages' elements. Additionally the page content was restricted to a certain width of the screen. If I were to use Jekyll for another project, I would want to be much more familiar with both it and the theme I chose to use, such as to better understand the way pages were generated.

## Building

To begin building the site, I first analysed the theme I was using, Identifying the HTML files used to generate the header and footer for pages. I then created html files for each of my 4 wireframed pages. 

I then worked on in order:

- The Header
- The Home Page
- The Login Page
- The Checkout Page
- The Shop Page
- The Footer

I also adjusted the global colour scheme to better reflect the palette I wanted.

Overall I now feel more confident using tools such as Jekyll to build sites, although the process to get there was frustrating.
